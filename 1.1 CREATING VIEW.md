View can be described as virtual table which derived its data from one or more than one table columns.
It is stored in the database. 
View can be created using tables of same database or different database. 
It is used to implement the security mechanism in the SQL Server.
Views are used for security purposes because they provide encapsulation of the name of the table.
Data is in the virtual table, not stored permanently. 
Views display only selected data.
